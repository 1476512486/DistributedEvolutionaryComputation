  * "The goal of the design optimization is obtaining a set of design parameters that maximizes a given fitness function. Due to the non-differentiable way we evaluate each design parameter, our design optimizer should be a gradient-free algorithm. We use CMA-ES for the optimization, which has been widely used in the design optimization literature as stated.The design optimization is implemented using PyCMA library. The design optimization is performed for 30 generations, with a population of 35 different designs. The design optimization takes about 1.4 hours of wall clock time using a desktop machine (CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4800h, GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650Ti, 16 GB Memory) without parallelization of the evaluation for each member of the population in the CMA-ES algorithm."

  * "The CMA-ES as an optimal sensor search algorithm is proven to be almost as effective and in any case more efficient than the exhaustive search. When a number of multiple near-global solutions may exist, the CMA-ES can provide a different optimal sensor configuration from the one provided by the exhaustive search. Nonetheless, these different configurations correspond to almost identical objective values and hence near-optimal sensor configurations."

  * "As different algorithms continue to advance in this area, a relatively new approach called Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was developed by Hansen et al. and considered to have potential to avoid local optimal results for engineering control cases. There has yet been little evidence using this algorithm for construction supply chain optimization. Using CMA-ES in this research can be viewed as a starting point to investigate advanced heuristic approach in manufacturing domain for the supply chain optimization in construction projects."
