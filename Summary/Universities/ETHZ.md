  * "The goal of the design optimization is obtaining a set of design parameters that maximizes a given fitness function. Due to the non-differentiable way we evaluate each design parameter, our design optimizer should be a gradient-free algorithm. We use CMA-ES for the optimization, which has been widely used in the design optimization literature as stated.The design optimization is implemented using PyCMA library. The design optimization is performed for 30 generations, with a population of 35 different designs. The design optimization takes about 1.4 hours of wall clock time using a desktop machine (CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4800h, GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650Ti, 16 GB Memory) without parallelization of the evaluation for each member of the population in the CMA-ES algorithm."

When a number of multiple near-global solutions may exist, the CMA-ES can provide a different optimal sensor configuration from the one provided by the exhaustive search. Nonetheless, these different configurations correspond to almost identical objective values and hence near-optimal sensor configurations."

Compared to other genetic algorithms, CMA-ES uses information related to the Hessian of the objective function, adapting the covariance matrix and sampling the search space along a preferential direction, leading to faster convergence."
