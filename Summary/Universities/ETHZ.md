  * "The goal of the design optimization is obtaining a set of design parameters that maximizes a given fitness function. Due to the non-differentiable way we evaluate each design parameter, our design optimizer should be a gradient-free algorithm. We use CMA-ES for the optimization, which has been widely used in the design optimization literature as stated.The design optimization is implemented using PyCMA library. The design optimization is performed for 30 generations, with a population of 35 different designs. The design optimization takes about 1.4 hours of wall clock time using a desktop machine (CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4800h, GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650Ti, 16 GB Memory) without parallelization of the evaluation for each member of the population in the CMA-ES algorithm."

  * "Because the CMA–ES method is not guaranteed to converge to the global maximum, and given that we cannot formulate lower bounds on the achieved objective value, we evaluate the method empirically in simulations."
  * "First, CMA–ES consistently outperformed BO and more distinctively so at higher numbers of control parameters (i.e., higher dimensional search space). Second, the required computation time was significantly lower for CMA–ES."
