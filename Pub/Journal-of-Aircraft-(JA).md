  * **Abstract**: "In this work, a novel approach for robust and reliability-based design optimization of aerodynamic shapes based on the combination of single- and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and a continuation multilevel Monte Carlo methodology is presented, to compute objective functions and constraints that involve statistical moments or statistical quantities, such as quantiles, also called value at risk and conditional value at risk, without relying on derivatives and meta-models."
  * "In this work, we present a new and effective procedure that leverages the self-tuning nature and robustness of C-MLMC to compute robust/reliable loss function and constraints that involve statistical moments and generalized quantiles (VAR and CVAR) combined with a covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) to solve the optimization problem."

  * "Here, an optimizer is coupled to a rotor comprehensive analysis tool and an acoustic prediction tool to solve the flap deployment schedule that minimizes noise. The optimizer used here is Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) formulated by Hansen and Ostermeier. The rotor analysis tool used here is the Rotor Comprehensive Analysis System."
  * "The optimal flap deployment schedule (to minimize noise) is found using an evolutionary algorithm optimizer coupled with a rotor analysis tool and an acoustic prediction code. Results indicated that active flap is able to provide noise reduction over the observer azimuth range of 150 to 210 deg with the average reduction level of 3 dB."
