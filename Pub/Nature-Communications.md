  * "In order to identify the optimal design, we couple our solver with the Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategy algorithm (CMA-ES, Hansen et al.). The CMA-ES is a stochastic optimization algorithm that progressively samples generations of parameter vectors (population of bots characterized by different layouts) from a multivariate Gaussian distribution N. While there is no mathematical proof of convergence to global optimum, CMA-ES has proven reliable in dealing with multi-modal, low-dimensional continuous problems and has been employed in a range of engineering and biophysical applications."
