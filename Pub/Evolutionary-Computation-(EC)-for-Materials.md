  * "We further show here that it is possible to tackle this challenge by fine-tuning their individual geometric parameters. The layout shown in [X] is used as an initial input for a particle swarm code paired with Lumerical (a commercial finite-difference time domain solver) for optimization, where the lengths, widths and height of the eight nanostructures are set as variables."
  * "To implement such process,we used Matlab to write a two-variable (phase shifts along x- and y-directions) particle swarm code by using the 1st order grating diffraction efficiency or wavefront aberration function as figure of merit. For the former figure of merit, the 1st-order diffraction efficiency was calculated by Fourier transform and scalar diffraction
theory, then the data was sent back to the Matlab particle swarm algorithm as feedback for the code to find the best shifts. In the latter, we used nanostructure phases from the library and calculated the
wavefront aberration functionwith respect to the target linear one. It is worth mentioning that the above process does not guarantee the global best solution because of approximations. We therefore repeated the above-mentioned process and generated ~30 different metagrating designs. The best one was reported in themain text while a few of the rest are shown in [X]."

  * **Abstract**: "Here, based on the particle swarm optimization method and first-principles calculations, we report an exotically icosahedral cage-like hypercoordinated IN6 compound composed of N6 rings and an unusual iodineâˆ’nitrogen covalent bond network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first halogen compound showing twelve-fold coordination of halogen."
