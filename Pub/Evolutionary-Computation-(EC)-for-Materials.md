  * "We further show here that it is possible to tackle this challenge by fine-tuning their individual geometric parameters. The layout shown in [X] is used as an initial input for a particle swarm code paired with Lumerical (a commercial finite-difference time domain solver) for optimization, where the lengths, widths and height of the eight nanostructures are set as variables."
