  * "Our optimization strategy first uses particle swarm optimization (PSO, Kennedy & Eberhart 1995) to identify a candidate solution. The PSO results (which should already be near the global likelihood-maximizing solution, in principle) are then imported into a more rigorous Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter and error inference using emcee."
