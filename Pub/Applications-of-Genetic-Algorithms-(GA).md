# Applications of Genetic Algorithms (GA)

In this openly-accessible page, we try to provide some (**rather all**) interesting applications of GA:

  * **Abstract**: "By incorporating the system’s governing equation into a genetic algorithm, we are able to efficiently identify a dispersion profile that produces a microcomb closely matching a user-defined target spectrum, such as spectrally flat combs or near-Gaussian pulses."

IEEE transactions on magnetics, 54(1), pp.1-12. { **GA** | **Massachusetts General Hospital + Harvard Medical School + Harvard University + Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and Technology** }
  * **Abstract**: "We present a method for designing an optimized cylindrical Halbach magnet using the genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve either homogeneity (for standard MRI applications) or a favorable spatial encoding field pattern (for rotational spatial encoding applications)."
  * "Because the optimization variables are integer and the appropriate metrics and constraints are non-linear, we use a GA to ensure high-quality designs. Because a simplified model was used to optimize the rSEM magnet and GA does not guarantee a global optimum, the optimization procedure was repeated multiple times and the results were further evaluated with full rSEM imaging simulations."
  * "There are 888 possible locations for the magnets in the full model, therefore M contains 888 variables that may only have values of 0, 1, 2 (3^888 possible designs)."
