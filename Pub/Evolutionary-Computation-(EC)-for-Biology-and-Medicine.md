  * "We used particle swarm optimization (PSO) to estimate model parameters characterizing the three population archetypes. We encoded the model structure in MATLAB SimBiology (R2021a) and used PSO to estimate the model parameters based on minimization of the log mean squared error between model simulations and data, using the ‘particleswarm’ function with 100 particles × 100 iterations and the lower limit of quantification set at 106 total cells. We fit the model separately to the CR, PR and NR populations by running the PSO algorithm 12 times for each population, generating a total of 36 parameter sets for analysis."
  * "We trained a logistic regression-based classifier using a genetic algorithm for feature selection. A genetic algorithm, implemented in R with the glmulti package, was used for feature selection on the 60% training split of the data, using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) with model accuracy as the objective function. For the genetic algorithm, we used a population size of 100 with a mutation rate of 0.001, an immigration rate of 0.3 and a reproduction rate of 0.1. Owing to the stochastic nature of genetic algorithms, this was repeated 2,500 times."

  * **Abstract**: "We present a method for designing an optimized cylindrical Halbach magnet using the genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve either homogeneity (for standard MRI applications) or a favorable spatial encoding field pattern (for rotational spatial encoding applications)."
  * "Because the optimization variables are integer and the appropriate metrics and constraints are non-linear, we use a GA to ensure high-quality designs."
