  * "A custom server-client chitecture was constructed. The server, implemented with Flask, hosts the optimization algorithm, collects results, generates new samples, and displays progress through a dashboard using Dash."
  * "Since the server and clients talk to each other using https, this framework could also handle evaluations distributed over a local network or internet."
  * "All models and optimization campaigns are run on NETLâ€™s Joule 2.0 supercomputer. Each node contains two 20 core Intel Xeon Gold 6148 CPUs clocked at 2.40GHz. The optimization campaigns each use four nodes, for a total of 160 cores. 20 simultaneous models are allowed to run on each node, totaling 80 concurrent simulations."
