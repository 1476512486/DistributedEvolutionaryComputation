# Swarm/Collective Intelligence

* [Collective intelligence: A unifying concept for integrating biology across scales and substrates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06037-4)
  * "Understanding how the behavior of subunits percolates up toward adaptive processes at higher levels, and how higher levels of organization constrain and facilitate the behavior of their parts, is critical not only to basic evolutionary biology but also to the control of system-level outcomes in biomedicine and to the design of novel engineered systems."
  * "Collective intelligence is an extremely exciting and interdisciplinary emerging field that spans from the most fundamental philosophical problems of the parts-whole relationship to advancing fundamental and applied discovery in a number of important subfields."
