  * "We further fitted the model using DEoptim which is a robust genetic algorithm that is known to perform stably on high-dimensional and multi-modal problems, to verify that the MCMC algorithm had not missed important regions of the parameter space. The models estimated with MCMC had significantly lower log root-mean-square error than models estimated with DEoptim (paired t-test NDVI analysis), suggesting that the MCMC algorithm performed well compared with the genetic algorithm."
