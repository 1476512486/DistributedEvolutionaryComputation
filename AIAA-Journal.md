  * "The optimization is performed using the algorithm CMA-ES, which was previously used to optimize morphing wings, because it satisfies the requirements of being able to treat nonsmooth objective functions and to deal with a large number of design variables. Compared to other genetic algorithms, CMA-ES uses information related to the Hessian of the objective function, adapting the covariance matrix and sampling the search space along a preferential direction, leading to faster convergence."
