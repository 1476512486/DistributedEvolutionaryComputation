  * "Minimization of the weighted RMSE was done by a differential evolution (DE) algorithm (Price et al., 2006; Storn & Price, 1997), using the DEoptim function from the same named package in R (Ardia et al., 2011). Here, a random “population” of N parameter sets is initially drawn from a constrained parameter space. Based on those, the algorithm tries to minimize the weighted RMSE by applying a strategy of parameter mutation, crossover, and selection over multiple iterations. As the number of iterations increases, the population members are drawn together and toward a joint (hopefully global) minimum of the function. Since DE algorithms are not prevalent in the diffusion model literature, we have applied our complete minimization procedure as a proof of concept"
