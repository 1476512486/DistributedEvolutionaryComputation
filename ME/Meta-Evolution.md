  * "To make a preliminary distinction between two kinds of mutation: ordinary changes within an existing genetic system, and changes to the genetic system itself"
  * "These changes to genetic systems must have been, at least in one sense, major changes, changes of a different order from the normal allele substitutions that go on within a genetic system."
  * "Although changes in genetic systems are much rarer than allelic substitutions within genetic systems, they are not very rare events on the geological timescale."
  * "A kind of higher-level selection, a selection not for survivability but for evolvability: It is only cumulative selection that is evolutionarily interesting, for only cumulative selection has the power to build new progress on the shoulders of earlier generations of progress, and hence the power to build up the formidable complexity that is diagnostic of life. Obviously the idea of each new adaptation serving as the background for the evolution of subsequent adaptations is commonplace, and is the essence of the idea of cumulative selection."
