  * "Here, an optimizer is coupled to a rotor comprehensive analysis tool and an acoustic prediction tool to solve the flap deployment schedule that minimizes noise. The optimizer used here is Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) formulated by Hansen and Ostermeier. The rotor analysis tool used here is the Rotor Comprehensive Analysis System."
