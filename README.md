# (Distributed) Evolutionary Computation (EC)

This is a *growing* paper list for **parallel and distributed** evolutionary computation (PDEC). Currently we are **actively** updating it (at least from 2021 to 2023). Owing to the abundance of the related literature, however, we believe that much interesting work is still missed here. If you find them missed, welcome to contact with us via [Issues](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/issues) or [Pull requests](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/pulls) to add.

Although our initial goal was to cover only PDEC, now our focus is switched to **Evolutionary Computation (EC)** researches and applications for (>30) chosen journals and conferences besides EC-specific publications (e.g., ECJ/IEEE-TEVC/ACM-TELO/ACM-FOGA/PPSN/ACM-GECCO/...). For EC-focused publications, currently still *only* Parallel/Distributed EC are covered.

## Review Scope

**WARNING**: In this paper repository, we do **NOT** judge the scientific/engineering value of each paper, since such a value judgement is often a non-trival task, depending on knowledge background and viewpoint. Instead, we **ONLY** provide a widely-accessible platform to collect papers regarding EC on some (rather all) *top-tier* and also *related EC-focused* journals as much as possible. Since *only* PDEC are covered for EC-focused publications, this paper collection may be **somewhat biased**, which should be noted.

## A (Relatively Big) Family of [Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/blob/main/Summary/EvolutionaryComputation.md)

Here, we consider a *relatively big* family of evolutionary algorithms (and also several closely related techniques, e.g., *random search* and *simulated annealing*), as presented below. Since here we focus primarily on their parallel/distributed versions and variants, we also provide a [ reference list](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/blob/main/Summary/EvolutionaryComputation.md) for their original / seminal / landmark / survey / review papers, in order to help better understand them (especially for newcomers). We strongly suggest to see e.g. [2015's Review paper in **Nature** or 1993's Review paper in **Science**](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/blob/main/Summary/EvolutionaryComputation.md#popular-naturescience-reviews) for more details.
