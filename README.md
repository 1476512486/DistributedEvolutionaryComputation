# Distributed Evolutionary Computation (EC)

This is a *growing* paper list for **parallel and distributed** evolutionary computation (PDEC). Currently we are **actively** updating this paper list (at least from 2021 to 2023). Owing to the abundance of the related literature, however, we believe that much interesting work is still missed here. If you find them missed in this paper list, welcome to contact with us via [Issues](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/issues) or [Pull requests](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/pulls) (and we will be very happy to add them).

## A (Relatively Big) Family of [Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/blob/main/Summary/EvolutionaryComputation.md)

In this review, we consider a *relatively big* family of evolutionary algorithms (and also several closely related techniques, e.g., *random search* and *simulated annealing*), as presented below. Since here we focus primarily on their parallel/distributed versions and variants, we also provide a [ reference list](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/blob/main/Summary/EvolutionaryComputation.md) for their original / seminal / landmark / survey / review papers, in order to help better understand them (especially for newcomers).
