# Distributed Evolutionary Computation

This is a *growing* paper list for **parallel and distributed** evolutionary computation (PDEC). Currently we are **actively** updating this paper list (at least from 2021 to 2023). Owing to the abundance of the related literature, however, we believe that much interesting work is still missed here. If you find them missed in this paper list, welcome to contact with us via [Issues](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/issues) or [Pull requests](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/pulls) (and we will be very happy to add them).

## A (Relatively Big) Family of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)

In this review, we consider a *relatively big* family of evolutionary algorithms (and also several closely related techniques, e.g., *random search* and *simulated annealing*), as presented below. Since here we focus primarily on their parallel/distributed versions and variants, we also provide a [ reference list](https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/DistributedEvolutionaryComputation/blob/main/Summary/EvolutionaryComputation.md) for their original/seminal/landmark/survey/review papers, in order to help better understand them (especially for newcomers).

* Four Conventional EAs

  * Genetic Algorithms (GA)
  
  * Evolution Strategies (ES)
  
  * Evolutionary Programming (EP)
  
  * Genetic Programming (GP)

* Two Swarm Intelligence (SI) Siblings

  * Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

  * Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

* Two Representative Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) Evolutionary Frameworks

  * Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)
  
  * Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D)

* Several Relatively New Extensions/Improvements/Variants

  * Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CEA) including both Cooperative and Competitive Evolution
  
  * Differential Evolution (DE)
  
  * Memetic Algorithms (MA)
  
  * Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA)
  
  * Natural Evolution Strategies (NES)
  
  * Quality-Diveristy (QD)
  
    * Multidimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites)

* NeuroEvolution (aka Evolving Neural Networks)

## Research Support

This *ongoing* review for PDEC is now supported by the **Shenzhen NSF** research project (from 2021 to 2023), granted to **Prof. Yuhui Shi** (CSE, SUSTech @ Shenzhen, China), and actively maintained/updated by his group members (e.g., *Qiqi Duan*, *Chang Shao*, Mingyang Feng, Minghan Zhang, Youkui Zhang, and Qi Zhao).
