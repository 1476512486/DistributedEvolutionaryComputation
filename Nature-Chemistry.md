  * "The parameters of SCEPTTr were then optimized by a genetic algorithm. Due to the high number of potential variables in SCEPTTr and the comparatively low population of each cycle and the number of cycles, the genetic algorithm cannot quite find the most optimal function; for this reason, we found it useful to run the genetic algorithm many times and use the results of the best iteration."
