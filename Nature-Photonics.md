  * "The geometry of the resonator (height, 670 nm; width, 280 nm) and pitch (400 nm) of the metasurface unit cell were optimized using a differential evolution algorithm operating on the results from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations (Methods).
  * "The design parameters of height and width of the resonator, pitch of the metasurface and the centre wavelength of the DBR stack were optimized using generic algorithms (differential evolution in Scipy45) to maximize the phase shift and reflection coefficients at the emission wavelength of the InAs QDs (1,250 nm) while minimizing the free-carrier absorption in the resonators.
