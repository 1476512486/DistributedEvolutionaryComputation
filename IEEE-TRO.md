  * "Although the inner layer is convex, the outer layer is not, and is not trivial to be reformulated as a convex problem. Therefore, we decided to use a stochastic global search. The optimizer we chose is the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES). It is a stochastic, derivative-free algorithm for black-box global optimization, in which the covariance matrix of the distribution of the candidate solutions is updated adaptively in each generation. This method learns a stochastic second-order approximation of the objective, and drives the candidate solutions to the optimum, even when the function is ill-conditioned."

  * "We solve this trajectory optimization problem using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is capable of handling optimization problems that have multiple local minima and discontinuous gradients. An important feature since the terrain cost-map introduces multiple local minima and gradient discontinuity."
