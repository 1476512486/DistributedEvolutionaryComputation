  * "Although the inner layer is convex, the outer layer is not, and is not trivial to be reformulated as a convex problem. Therefore, we decided to use a stochastic global search. The optimizer we chose is the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES). It is a stochastic, derivative-free algorithm for black-box global optimization, in which the covariance matrix of the distribution of the candidate solutions is updated adaptively in each generation. This method learns a stochastic second-order approximation of the objective, and drives the candidate solutions to the optimum, even when the function is ill-conditioned."

  * "We solve this trajectory optimization problem using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is capable of handling optimization problems that have multiple local minima and discontinuous gradients. An important feature since the terrain cost-map introduces multiple local minima and gradient discontinuity."

  * "To meet these requirements, we make use of the CMA-ES optimization technique."
  * "From this starting point, a CMA-ES optimizer is first run considering the entire search space. This was done by setting the initial multivariate Gaussian to have a σ that is 50% of the extent of our search space. Once this optimization has been performed, the approach is rerun, this time making use of the variance estimate provided by the motion stage and using this information to initialize CMA-ES’s Gaussian distribution."
