  * "The swarm-intelligence-based CALYPSO method and code were employed for searching low-energy 2D Sr−B monolayers. Its validity has been manifested by successful identification of the ground-state structures for a large number of systems."

  * "By means of density functional theory (DFT) computations and global minimum search using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, we predicted three FeB6 monolayers, namely α-FeB6, β-FeB6 and γ-FeB6, which consist of the Fe©Bx (x = 6, 8) wheels with planar hypercoordinate Fe atoms locating at the center of six- or eight-membered boron rings."
