  * "The swarm-intelligence-based CALYPSO method and code were employed for searching low-energy 2D Sr−B monolayers. Its validity has been manifested by successful identification of the ground-state structures for a large number of systems."

  * "Crystal structure exploration methods based on particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithms led to 25 distinct structures, including 23 dynamically stable structures, all quite close to each other in energy, but not in detailed structure."

  * "By means of density functional theory (DFT) computations and global minimum search using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, we predicted three FeB6 monolayers, namely α-FeB6, β-FeB6 and γ-FeB6, which consist of the Fe©Bx (x = 6, 8) wheels with planar hypercoordinate Fe atoms locating at the center of six- or eight-membered boron rings."
