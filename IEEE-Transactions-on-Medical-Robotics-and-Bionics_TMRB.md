  * "We use a human-in-theloop method with candidate profiles of 15-steps which aims to minimize knee extensor muscle activity, utilizing the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy algorithm (CMA-ES) and a cost function based on normalized RMS of surface EMG signals. By utilizing CMA-ES, we vary the magnitude and timing of Myosuit’s support to find the most appropriate assistance profiles."
